## Sanctuary Preset

This is my "preset" for all my Laravel projects. Instead of wasting time doing the same setup for pretty much every Laravel project I've made in the past year, I can simply pull this in through composer, run `php artisan preset sanctuary`, and be on my way! It will do things like setup a homepage, common layout files, scaffold my JS and SCSS files, and etc...

Install it via composer by running:

```sh
composer require danktuary/sanctuary-preset
```
